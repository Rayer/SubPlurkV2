Dependency : 
1. Jake Wharton's ActionBarSherlock : https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock
   For install guide, please refer to http://actionbarhserlock.com

   This is the most famous ActionBar implementation, contributed by Jake Wharton, and I use it to replace Android Compibility Package.
 
2. Jake Wharton's ViewPageIndicator : https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator

   Another masterpiece of this guy, I use it as view page flipper.

3. Myself Utilities : https://github.com/Rayer/Utilities 

   I suggest anyone to take a look into ResourceProxy and ResourceProvisioner, it is a pretty implement and may be useful for anyone.
